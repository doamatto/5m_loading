To change the server name and add an extra footer line, you can use the `serverName` and `serverFooter` lines in `script.js`. At the top of the file, look for a chunk of like this:
```js
// For help configuring, go to https://github.com/doamatto/5m_loading/wiki/
var conf = {
  // There's more above that isn't relevant to this page. It's shortened for brevity.

  serverName: "Your Server Name",
  serverFooter: "A certified hood classic.",

  // There's more below that isn't relevant to this page. It's shortened for brevity.
};
```

Simply add your server name and a footer in between the quotation marks to have it setup on the loading screen.
