There are four backgrounds as of v0.3.0 in 5mLoading:
- **Static:** a simple dark background
- **Rainbow:** an animated gradient of a rainbow that slides through while you wait, and:
- **Carousel:** an image slideshow that can slide through several images in a constant loop while you wait.

## Setting your Background
Inside of `script.js`, the first couple of lines read the following:
```js
var conf = {
  // There should be more here than mentioned; this is shortened for brevity purposes
  bg: "static", // Options: static, animated, carousel
  carouselImages: [
    "https://files.catbox.moe/vpqvxx.jpg",
    "https://files.catbox.moe/pzz9cp.jpg",
    "https://files.catbox.moe/mq6k5x.png",
    "https://files.catbox.moe/bh9yy0.png",
    "https://files.catbox.moe/205gkr.jpg",
    "https://files.catbox.moe/d49sa5.jpg",
    "https://files.catbox.moe/efys1k.png"
  ]
};
```

By changing the value of bg to:
- `"static"`, you get the **Static** background,
- `"animated"`, you get the **Rainbow** background,
- `"carousel"`, you get the **Carousel** background; and:
- `"video"`, you get to use a video as a background.

## Configuring Carousel Images
The image carousel can have a virtually endless amount of pictures. I personally recommend no more than ten, as these pictures do still have to be downloaded and embed into the loading screen.

Following [the rules of JavaScript arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp), you can easily add and remove pictures as you please. To add a new link to the list, you can add the following to the `carouselImages` array:
```js
  carouselImages: [
    "https://example.org/totally-real-picture.png"
  ]
```

If you have an issues with adding new items to this array, ensure you're following the general rules outlined from the link above and, if you're still having problems, [create an issue](https://github.com/doamatto/5m_loading/issues/new) with your config included.

## Configuring video backgrounds
After changing to the `"video"` mode, you need to set the value for `video`. This can be anything that is a valid video format supported by [the <video> element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Video).

It's recommended that videos are kept short and compressed to allow quick loading and little to no issues while the loading screen loads. Video audio will not be playedâ€” this is intended as it adds unnecessary friction to the music engine.
